# templates

I love [{pagedown}](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) but the templates are pretty strict.  So I've made some of my own.

## poster-morrison:  

This is a pagedown template and css for Mike Morrison's "better poster" style.  Powerpoint template can be found [here](https://osf.io/ef53g/) and LaTeX template can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/better-poster-latex-template/gmkgjvxqbyyt).

I created it with the very clunky strategy of editing the css for the {pagedown} "relaxed" poster template, and feeding the custom css to the frontmatter.  Undoubtedly, there are a lot of lingering options in the css that are not necessary, but that I was too afraid to delete.

## poster-kb  (still fiddling with this one, don't use it!)

I love the ideas behind Morrison's poster style, but there are a couple things I don't like.  (See e.g. [this critique](http://betterposters.blogspot.com/2019/04/critique-morrison-billboard-poster.html) )

This version is just my picky personal poster style.
